# traffic_signs

The purpose of the repository is to create a LeNet convolutional neural network to classify images of road signs. 

The steps are:

1. Import machine learning modules

2. Import labelled image data

3. Preprocess road signs (grayscale, histogram equalization, normalize)

4. Create a LeNet model 

5. Test the LeNet model.

__Traffic Sign Labelled Image Data__: https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs

__How to Use__: This code is intended to be run on Google Colab as a Python 3 Notebook, as the model fitting is faster with GPU processing. 

Press `Runtime`> `Change runtime type` > `Hardware Accelerator` > `GPU` to improve the runtime signficantly.
